how many had a form of stroke as reason for diagnosis?

median age at diagnosis?

```

median age at rupture?
```{r}
summary(adb.raw$age.at.time.of.diagnosis[which(adb.raw$Ruptured_IA=="Yes")])
```

Compare to Morel et al. 2021: 
Median age at aneurysm rupture was 52 years (range 10-92), 
25% of patients were <44 and 75% were <61 years of age.
